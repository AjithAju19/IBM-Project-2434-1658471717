<h3>Introduction </h3>
<hr/>

Industries are being redefined by digital disruption, and firms are operating differently. Every sector is evaluating its alternatives and implementing strategies to provide value in the technology-driven environment. The most notable of these revolutionary shifts in the banking industry is the growing emphasis on the needs of the consumer.


Customers that are tech aware and regularly interact with cutting-edge technologies want banks to provide smooth experiences. For services like mobile banking, e-banking, and real-time money transfers, banks have expanded their industrial landscape to include retail, IT, and telecom in order to meet these expectations.
